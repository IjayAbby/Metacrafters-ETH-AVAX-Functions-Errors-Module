## METACRAFTERS ETH + AVAX PROOF: Intermediate EVM Course
## MODULE: Functions and Errors - ETH + AVAX

### SIMPLE DAPP

This program serves as the final assessment for the aforementioned module. It is a basic smart contract that uses the *assert*, *require*, and *revert* statements. I also incorporated events and modifiers to ensure that I fully practiced the material I learned in this module. 

## Description

This Solidity program is a simple implementation of a token transfer dapp where users register, mint 100 tokens to them selves for free then are able to transfer these tokens to one another as long as the receiver is also registered on the smart contract.
